# Simple To-Do List App (JavaScript)

***A minimal and interactive to-do list application built with vanilla JavaScript.***

## Description
This project allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks instantly. Each new task appears dynamically on the page, and completed tasks are visually crossed out for easy tracking. The interface updates in real time without page reloads.

## Features
- Add new tasks instantly  
- Mark tasks as **Done** (line-through + greyed out)  
- Delete tasks permanently  
- Automatically clears input after each submission  

## How It Works
The app listens for form submissions, creates task elements dynamically, and attaches event listeners to handle task completion and deletion.
